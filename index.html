	<h2> About Me</h2>
		<p> Hi, I'm a new web developer looking to grow into a career of full stack web development. I have been learning HTML, CSS, native Javascript and new shortcuts, JQUERY and more to come. I will certainly be looking forward to getting to know you since I enjoy telecommunication. 

		On a personal level, my interests are on a wide spectrum. My experience and skill is primarily a background of food-service, personal customer service, marketing, promotion, and management. I have a fascination for holistic nutrition and wellness with a passion for the science of medicine and chemistry. My niche interest is in the brain and neuropsychology. I love yoga, cycling, rowing, hiking, camping, travel, photography, music, film, learning new things in general, and spending special time with those I love the most. I have a history of pushing hard through any problem and a drive to bring my best to any job I tackle. I have a vast appreciation for constructive feedback and believe that good communication and critical thinking can solve many issues in inconsistencies or inefficiencies. </p>
